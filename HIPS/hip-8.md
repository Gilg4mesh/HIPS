| 8 | Introduce derivative tokens as weights to vote | 0x0E29e5AbbB5FD88e28b2d355774e73BD47dE3bcd | 2020-09-15 15:00 | 1 |

### Summary
Should we introduce derivative tokens, BPT for instance, to represent proportional rights?

### Details

Some HAKKAs are locked in either pool #2 or pool #3. It would be inconvenient for HAKKA holders who staked their tokens into the pools to vote via our governance system. Therefore, we propose to take the HAKKA-derivative tokens (BPT, Balancer Pool Token) as their weight. 

By introducing the mechanism, those who staked their HAKKA into reward pools would be still able to vote on our governance platform. We expect to see more HAKKA holders participate in the governance of ecosystem.


### Options
1. Great. Enable HAKKA-derivative tokens to vote
2. No. Do not introduce this feature
