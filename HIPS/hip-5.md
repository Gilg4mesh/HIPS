| 5 | Initiate Reward Pool #3 for HAKKA/ETH pair | 0x0E29e5AbbB5FD88e28b2d355774e73BD47dE3bcd | 2020-09-07 | 1 |

### Summary
Initiate the 3rd reward pool for liquidity provider of HAKKA/ETH pair on Balancer

### Details

HAKKA token represents our decentralized community governance right. To get more community engagement, the liquidity of HAKKA is essential. Hence, we propose to open a new reward pool to attract more users to get into our DeFi world!


Now, we only have 2 HAKKA reward pools at https://rewards.hakka.finance/pools to incentivize people to provide liquidity for the BlackHoleSwap. Nevertheless, HAKKA should get more exposure as BlackHoleSwap to empower the community to involve and build a better ecosystem. Therefore, we propose initiating pool #3, HAKKA/ETH pair, to reward the liquidity providers. By doing so, we expect to see a greater liquidity of HAKKA and a more stable HAKKA price.

Based on the poll result of HIP-4, we will transfer the major liquidity from Uniswap to Balancer, so pool #3 will require people to stake BPT of (HAKKA/ETH) pair to earn the reward.
