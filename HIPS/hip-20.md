### Summary
Vesting period for HAKKA mining reward

### Details

To stablize the supply of HAKKA, we would like to introduce a vesting period for HAKKA mining reward. Once this feature implemented, HAKKA reward will be locked up for a certain period, which will be determined by another HIP thereafter.

By doing so, we may align interest of liquidity providers, users, and HAKKA holders. However, this act might reduce potencial user acquisition as well.

We sincerely invite all the HAKKA holders to vote for or against this feature.

### Options
1. Yes. Let's do it!
2. No. Do not introduce it.
