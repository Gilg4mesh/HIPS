| 3 | Start Liquidity Mining Now? | 0x0E29e5AbbB5FD88e28b2d355774e73BD47dE3bcd | 2020-08-25 | 1 |

### Summary
BlackHoleSwap contract is under another audit. Shall we initiate liquidity mining right now or wait?

### Details
The reason why liquidity mining has not yet been initiated is that the contract of BlackHoleSwap is still under another audit. To be more careful, even though PeckShield has already audited the beta version BlackHoleSwap, we send it to another audit company. We have to wait until Sep. 2nd to receive the report. However, the community can’t wait to start mining, so we have to decide whether to kick off liquidity mining now or wait until the second audit finishes?

The risk of initiating liquidity mining now would be that once there is a bug in BlackHoleSwap contract, it could put all the assets of the liquidity provider into great danger.

However, we’re in a fast-changing market, so maybe waiting until Sep. 2nd could be a higher risk for Hakka Finance.

We want to let the HAKKA community decide such an important issue.

### Options

2. Wait until the audit is finished (Sep. 2nd).
